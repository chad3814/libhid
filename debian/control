Description: userspace USB HID development files
 libhid provides a generic and flexible way to access and interact with USB
 HID devices, much like libusb does for plain USB devices. It is based on
 libusb, thus it requires no HID support in the kernel and provides means to
 take control over a device even if the kernel governs it.
