libhid
======

This is just an import of the svn of libhid at svn://svn.debian.org/libhid/trunk

I am not the maintainer. If you want to build, run the autogen.sh in the top-level directory followed by make.

libhid is under the GPL v2. This sucks for libraries, blah blah blah. Unless the hidparser component (from MGE) is either rewritten or relicensed there's nothing that can be done. See https://github.com/chad3814/libhid/blob/master/README.licence

See https://github.com/chad3814/libhid/blob/master/README.svn for the original README from svn.
