<h1>libhid</h1>

<p>Welcome to the webpage for libhid, a user-space HID access library
written in C. It provides a generic and flexible way to access and interact
with USB HID devices, much like libusb does for plain USB devices. It is based
on <a href="http://libusb.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">libusb 0.1</a>, thus it
requires no HID support in the kernel. Furthermore, it aims to support all
operating system supported by libusb: Linux, BSD, OS X, and Windows.</p>

<p>libhid is still under development and it does not have a proper homepage (if
you want to write one, please <a
href="mailto:libhid-discuss@lists.alioth.debian.org">contact us</a>!). Until one is
ready, you are welcome to download the software and try it out, it should be
easy to use if you have some knowledge of C and are willing to read someone
else's code. Some <a href="/doc/" target="_blank">API documentation</a> has been generated
using <a href="http://www.doxygen.org" target="_blank">Doxygen</a>, but it is
far from complete (again, if you want to help, please <a
href="mailto:libhid-discuss@lists.alioth.debian.org">contact us</a>!).</p>

<p>For a simple example on how to use libhid, please check out <a
href="http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/libhid/trunk/test/test_libhid.c"
target="_blank">test_libhid.c</a>.</p>

<p>For more information, please consult the <a
href="http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/libhid/trunk/README?op=file&amp;rev=0&amp;sc=0"
target="_blank">README</a>.</p>

<h2>Mailing lists</h2>

<p>Development of libhid is currently coordinated with mailing lists and Subversion
(see further down). The following three mailing lists exist (click on the list
name to go to the list information page):</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/libhid-announce"
target="_blank"><strong>libhid-announce</strong></a> [ <a
href="http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/libhid-announce/"
target="_blank">archives</a> ] -- a moderated list with
very low volume for announcements. Everyone should subscribe here.</li>

<li><a href="http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/libhid-discuss"
target="_blank"><strong>libhid-discuss</strong></a> [ <a
href="http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/libhid-discuss/"
target="_blank">archives</a> ] -- a subscriber-only list
for general discussion. Everyone is cordially invited to join and
participate.</li>

<li><a href="http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/libhid-commits"
target="_blank"><strong>libhid-commits</strong></a> [ archived via <a
href="http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/libhid/" target="_blank">websvn</a> ] --
a mailing list receiving Subversion (svn) commit mails. If you want to closely
track libhid development, you probably want to subscribe to this list.</li>

</ul>

<p>We realise that the documentation and instructions we provide with the
library are far from usable. Thus, please do not hesitate to <a
href="mailto:libhid-discuss@lists.alioth.debian.org">write to us</a> on the discussion
list!</p>

<h2>Getting libhid</h2>

<p>libhid is available through various ways. In the following, we list the
possibilities in decreasing order of preference/currency:</p>

<h3>Subversion (svn)</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_blank">Subversion</a>
tree is the most current development repository.  The CVS version history has
been imported into in the Subversion repository as well.</p>

<p><strong>Update (2006-06-29):</strong> The SVN repository has moved <b>again</b>. We are now back at Alioth. (Many thanks to Martin Krafft for hosting libhid for these past two years.) If you have
a checked out copy, please relocate it. If you have read-only access, use the
first command. With write access, use the second:</p>

<code>
svn sw --relocate svn://svn.{ailab.ch,debian.org}/svn/libhid/trunk<br />
svn sw --relocate svn+ssh://svn.{ailab.ch/home/svn/external,debian.org/svn}/libhid/trunk
</code>

<p>To check out the latest version of libhid into the directory
<tt>libhid-svn</tt>, ensure that Subversion is installed, and use the
following command:</p>

<code>
svn co svn://svn.debian.org/libhid/trunk libhid-svn
</code>

<p>Instructions on how to compile the code are available in the <a
href="./README" target="_blank">README</a> file. Please do not hesitate to
write to the <a href="mailto:libhid-discuss@lists.alioth.debian.org">mailing list</a>
if you have questions, comments, or problems.</p>

<p>The Subversion tree can also be viewed <a
href="http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/libhid/" target="_blank">online</a> via
websvn. The latest version is available at the <a
href="http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/libhid/trunk/"
target="_blank">trunk</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to contribute, please send a patch or two to the libhid-discuss
mailing list (please keep patches under 20KB, or gzip them before attaching
them).  After a few patches have been accepted, it would not be unreasonable
for you to ask for SVN write access. For that, you would need an account on <a
href="http://alioth.debian.org"
target="_blank">Alioth</a>. You can <a
href="http://alioth.debian.org/account/register.php" target="_blank">sign
up</a> for free (and need not be affiliated with Debian).</p>

<!-- 

<h3>CVS</h3>

<p>The CVS tree contains all changes to libhid through October 2004. You can
check it out in read-only mode with the following commands (the password is
empty, so just hit enter when prompted):</p>

<code>
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.ailab.ch:/home/cvs/external login<br />
cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.ailab.ch:/home/cvs/external co libhid 
</code>
-->

<!-- <p>In addition, the CVS tree can be viewed <a
href="http://svn.ailab.ch/cgi-bin/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/libhid/"
target="_blank">online</a>.</p> -->

<h3>Debian</h3>

<!--
<p>libhid has entered Debian, but the versions may be a little behind. You can
use my (madduck's) repository to always get the latest versions. Simply add
the following to your <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt> file:</p>

<code>
deb     http://debian.madduck.net ~madduck/packages/stage/libhid/<br />
deb-src http://debian.madduck.net ~madduck/packages/stage/libhid/
</code>

<p>and then install it. You may leave out <tt>python-hid</tt> if you do not
want the Python bindings:</p>
-->

<p>libhid is in Debian, and was included in sarge (3.1). To install:</p>

<code>
# apt-get install libhid-dev python-hid
</code>

<!-- 
<p>The packages and the archive are signed. More information is available <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~madduck/packages#signatures"
target="_blank">here</a>.
-->

<h3>Tarball</h3>

<!--
<p>Of course, libhid is available as a tarball from <a
href="http://debian.madduck.net/~madduck/packages/stage/libhid/source/"
target="_blank">the Debian repository</a>. Simply find the latest file with
the extension <tt>.orig.tar.gz</tt>, download it, unpack it, and then do
the standard</p>
-->

<p>You may download a tarball of libhid from Alioth at the
<a href="http://alioth.debian.org/frs/?group_id=30451" target="_blank">download page
for libhid</a> by selecting the link for the latest libhid-*.tar.gz file.
Unpack it, then run:</p>

<code>
$ ./configure &amp;&amp; make<br />
$ su<br />
# make install
</code>

<p>to install it into <tt>/usr/local</tt>. </p>

<h2>A note about languages</h2>

<p>At time of writing, libhid can be used directly from C/C++, or from <a
href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank">Python</a>. It is possible for us
to provide further language bindings, thanks to <a href="http://www.swig.org"
target="_blank">Swig</a>. Thus, if you need to use HID devices from any other
of the <a href="http://www.swig.org/compare.html" target="_blank">languages
supported by Swig</a>, it should be trivial to add support. Just echo your
desires to <a href="mailto:libhid-discuss@lists.alioth.debian.org">the discussion
list</a>, but bear in mind that the libhid developers cannot guarantee support
for any given language.</p>

<p>For a simple example on how to use libhid from Python, please check out <a
href="http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/libhid/trunk/swig/test_libhid.py"
target="_blank">this script</a>.</p>

<h2>Licence</h2>

<p>libhid is released under the terms of the <a
href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php"
target="_blank">GPL</a> version 2.</p>

<p>We realise that this is a serious impediment. The GPL is
a &quot;viral&quot; licence, and you will only be able to use libhid in other
GPL projects. We would like to change the licence, but libhid uses the <a
href="http://www.mgeups.com/opensource/projects/hidparser.htm"
target="_blank">MGE UPS SYSTEMS HID Parser</a>, which is GPL, and thus we
cannot. Our solution is to rewrite the HID parser. One of these days. We are
also in contact with MGE, trying to convince them to loosen their licence.
If the licencing issues are solved, we are likely to re-release libhid under
the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license.php"
target="_blank">Artistic Licence</a>.</p>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>libhid grew out of <a href="http://www.ghz.cc/~clepple/libHID/doc/html/"
