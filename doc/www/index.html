<h1>libhid</h1>

<p>This is a temporary webpage for libhid, a user-space HID access library
written in C. It provides a generic and flexible way to access and interact
with USB HID devices, much like libusb does for plain USB devices. It is based
on <a href="http://libusb.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">libusb</a>, thus it
requires no HID support in the kernel.</p>

<p>libhid is still under development and it does not have a proper homepage (if
you want to write one, please <a
href="mailto:libhid-discuss@lists.ailab.ch">contact us</a>!). Until one is
ready, you are welcome to download the software and try it out, it should be
easy to use if you have some knowledge of C and are willing to read someone
else 's code. Documentation does not yet exist, but we are working to provide
it using <a href="http://www.dogygen.org" target="_blank">Doxygen</a>
