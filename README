libhid README
=============

Revision: $Id: README,v 1.2 2004/05/25 21:37:52 krafft Exp $

Please send bugreports to <libhid@lists.ailab.ch>.

Introduction

Notes
-----

Note that the library is not (yet) complete and it's not thoroughly tested.
However, given the effort and grief I went through in writing it, I would
like to make it available to folks, get people to test it, and hopefully have
some peeps submit improvements. If you have any suggestions, please write to
me at krafft@ailab.ch.

It's not yet documented, although the usage should be fairly straight
forward. I am hoping to find someone else to document it as I suck at
documentation and as the author, it's exceptionally difficult to stay
didactically correct.

Usage
-----

The library supports pkg-config. Thus, to compile with the library,

  #include <hid.h>

and in your Makefile:

  CPPFLAGS += `pkg-config libhid --cflags`
  LDFLAGS += `pkg-config libhid --libs`

If using automake, use the AM_* versions of the two variables.

Have fun.
